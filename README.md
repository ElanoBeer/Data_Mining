# Data Mining: What is the effect of guided meditation on the distribution of sleep stages?

In this study it was researched whether guided meditation had an effect on the sleep stages of individuals, this was done by having the individuals listen to a singular guided meditation video directly before going to sleep. An example of which would be the video which could be found by following [this link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft-vhYwHzxw). This is just an example, as students were free to choose their own video of choice which as long as it was a guided meditation which was aimed at going to sleep. 

To be able to conduct the trial, there were two weeks of testing and two weeks of control collection. These should both be done consecutively, so either first two weeks of testing or first the two weeks of control sampling. However, due to measurement limitations, this was not always possible and was resolved by either using one week each or by splitting the control sampling to one week before and one week after the two weeks of the guided meditation.

As students there were of course some variables which might be seen as bottlenecks and which should be taken into account. For instance, there are varying variances and length of sleep schedules leading to the data having to be normalized with a metric like percentages. Next, alcohol usage causes a higher heart rate due to the fact that the liver needs to filter this. Thus, leading to possible distorted values in these nights. Moreover, there were a variety of different watches which were used to track the data. Where subjects 1-4 used the Xiaomi Smartband 7, subject 5 used the Apple Watch SE 2, which have different sensors and different ways of measuring. Therefore, it is possible that there is a deviation between the readings of these subjects. Finally, it became apparent that for some students there were some nights for which no sleeping data was recorded, which could either originate from a measurement error, or from the fact that a student forgot to wear his/her smartwatch

The data is all produced in the same format. The data already contain a preprocessed pandas dataframe which can be opened using pd.read_pickle. The data in the dataframe had the following format:
